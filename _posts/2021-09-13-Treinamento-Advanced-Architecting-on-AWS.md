Na última semana tive a oportunidade em realizar mais um treinamento AWS, oferecido pela empresa.

O treinamento é o **Advanced Architecting on AWS**.

Sobre o Treinamento: 
In this course, each module presents a scenario with an architectural challenge to be solved. 
You will examine available AWS services and features as solutions to the problem. 
You will gain insights by participating in problem-based discussions and learning about the AWS services that you could apply to meet the challenges. 
Over 3 days, the course goes beyond the basics of a cloud infrastructure and covers topics to meet a variety of needs for AWS customers. 
Course modules focus on managing multiple AWS accounts, hybrid connectivity and devices, networking with a focus on AWS Transit Gateway connectivity, container services, automation tools for continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), security and distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection, data lakes and data stores, edge services, migration options, and managing costs. 
The course concludes by presenting you with scenarios and challenging you to identify the best solutions.
