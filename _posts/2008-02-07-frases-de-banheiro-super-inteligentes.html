<p><u><strong>Tequila and Salt</strong></u></p>
<p>This should probably be taped to your bathroom mirror where one could read it every day.  You may not realize it, but it's 100% true.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are at least two people in this world that you would die for.</li>
<li>At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.</li>
<li>The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you.</li>
<li>A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you.</li>
<li>Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.</li>
<li>You mean the world to someone.</li>
<li>You are special and unique.</li>
<li>Someone that you don't even know exists loves you.</li>
<li>When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.</li>
<li>When you think the world has turned its back on you take another look.</li>
<li>Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude remarks.</li>
</ul>
