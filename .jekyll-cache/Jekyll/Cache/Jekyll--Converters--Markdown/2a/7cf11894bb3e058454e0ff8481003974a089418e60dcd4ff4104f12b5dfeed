<blockquote><p>Greg's Cable Map is an attempt to consolidate all the available information about the undersea communications infrastructure. The initial data was harvested from Wikipedia, and further information was gathere by simply googling and transcribing as much data as possible into a useful format, namely a rich geocoded format. I hope you find the resource useful and any constructive criticism is welcome.A mate of mine did an article on it on his South African Tech site, Check it out if you want more background info.</p></blockquote>
