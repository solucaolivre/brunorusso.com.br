I"¹<p>Committee Rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never arrive on time, or you will be stamped a beginner.</li>
<li>Don't say anything until the meeting is half over; this stamps you as being wise.</li>
<li>Be as vague as possible; this prevents irritating the others.</li>
<li>When in doubt, suggest that a subcommittee be appointed.</li>
<li>Be the first to move for adjournment; this will make you popular -- it's what everyone is waiting for.</li>
</ol>
